# How to disable inline code completion in IDEa

It is very very simple to write your code using `TAB` key.

And if you don't want to lose your skills and become a passive vegetable, there are several options to disable this jIDEa feature:
1. Disable `Full Line Code Completion` plugin - this is the most radical approach
2. `goto` Settings -> Editor -> General -> Inline Completion -> tune it as you wish
3. [Check Jetbrains Docs](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/full-line-code-completion.html)
4. Or keep going on your degradation path
