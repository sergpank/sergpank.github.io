# I'd like to create my own keyboard with mini led matrixes on keykaps.
5x7 indicator would be fine for that, it can display almost all cyrillic letters and all latin.  
It's size is 12.7mm x 17.8 mm. This is slightly bigger that 1.5mm that is standard key size, but should be fine.

Here is the fond example:
