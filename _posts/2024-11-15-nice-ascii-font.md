It sounds ridiculous but it always takes me a lot of time to find and nice readable ASCII font for Spring Boot banner.

We all know that on startup SpringBoot app prints a nice banner in console, and it can be overriden in `src/main/resources/banner.txt` file

I found 2 fonts that LGTM and for my colleagues:
[Standard](https://patorjk.com/software/taag/#p=display&f=Standard&t=TEST) and [Small](https://patorjk.com/software/taag/#p=display&f=Small&t=TEST)
```
// Standard
  _____ _____ ____ _____ 
 |_   _| ____/ ___|_   _|
   | | |  _| \___ \ | |  
   | | | |___ ___) || |  
   |_| |_____|____/ |_| 

// Small
  _____ ___ ___ _____ 
 |_   _| __/ __|_   _|
   | | | _|\__ \ | |  
   |_| |___|___/ |_|  
```

None of them looks perfect, just acceptable.
