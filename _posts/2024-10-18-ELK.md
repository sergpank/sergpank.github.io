# Some ELK hacks, which was difficult to google or learn

## 1. By default, when data is sent from Logstash to Elasticsearch with elasticsearch {} plugin, index with 2 shards is created - primary and replica.
This is not acceptable when you are limited with disk space.  
I found only one solution for this proble - edit corresponding `Index Template` in Kibana.  
```json
{
  "index": {
    "number_of_replicas": "0"
  }
}
```
Because these are default values when a new index is created:  
```yaml
index:
  number_of_shards: 1
  number_of_replicas: 1
```
